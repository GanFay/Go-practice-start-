# Number Guessing Game

A simple console-based number guessing game written in **Go**.  
The computer randomly selects a number, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## How It Works
- The game randomly picks a number within a specified range.
- You (the player) try to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program tells you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- You have a limited number of attempts.
- If you guess the number correctly, you win.
- If you run out of attempts, the game ends and reveals the correct number.

## Features
- Random number generation
- User-friendly prompts
- Limited attempts for added challenge

## How to Play
1. Run the program in your terminal.
2. Enter your guesses when prompted.
3. Follow the hints ("too high" or "too low") to narrow down the number.
4. Try to guess the number before your attempts run out!

## Requirements
- Go installed on your system
- A terminal/command prompt to run the program
