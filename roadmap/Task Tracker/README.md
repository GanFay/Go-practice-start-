Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this task, you will build a simple command line interface to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs

The user can be to:

* Add, Update, and Delete tasks

* Mark a task as in progress or done

* List all tasks

* List all tasks that are done

* List all tasks that are not done

* List all tasks that are in progress
